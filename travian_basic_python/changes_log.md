## Enumerating possible paths to build the game
Gym, a library from OpenAI (https://github.com/openai/gym/issues) creates games in gym-environments where Q-learning algorithms can be executed.

How to create a basic game OpenAI style:

## Managing legality of actions
Some actions are illegal along the game (due to lack of resources). Should the action space change each turn? When should the purchase-power-check be made?

Post that defends replacing the action space by a legal action space: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/378008/how-to-handle-a-changing-action-space-in-reinforcement-learning
Post that explains AlphaGo's choice in this matter (also replacing action space by legal action space): https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/328835/enforcing-game-rules-in-alpha-go-zero

### How should the legal action space be implemented?

## Daily steps
### 2022-11-06 | Starting with Gym
I start following https://blog.paperspace.com/getting-started-with-openai-gym/

While installing "baselines" I deleted a couple packages and I almost deleted OpenCV ðŸ˜±
See "1.- Error" at snippets_log.md

### 2022-12-02 | Reset & Step
I keep following https://blog.paperspace.com/creating-custom-environments-openai-gym/
Legality of actions

### 2022-12-06 | Unify classes
turn functions was moved into travian_classes' Dorf
Village class from travian_gym_qlearning was made child of Dorf
log cleanned, by moving snippets to another file
tests passed
